This is an attempt to implement JPS algorithm for 3D pathfinding. It is still not the finished but somewhat finalized version.

You can feed the algorithm with the 3D-grid and it will find the correct path, but this project was supposed to just be a test so it might be difficult to integrate to another project.
Feel free to use at your own risk.
